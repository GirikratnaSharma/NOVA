# NOVA — Neural Operator for Virtual Assistance

> An intelligent mission support system powered by RAG and Transformer-based language models.

---

## Project Overview

**NOVA** (Neural Operator for Virtual Assistance) is a next-gen software AI assistant designed to simulate decision-making and procedural support for spaceflight environments.

Built using modern NLP techniques — including transformer models from Hugging Face and document retrieval via FAISS — NOVA allows users to query space mission procedures, logs, and protocols in natural language.

Think of it as **HAL 9000**, minus the existential threat.

## Features

- **RAG** pipeline
- Answers grounded in real mission documents (e.g., EVA checklists, system protocols)
- Hugging Face Transformers integration
- Natural language query support for mission-critical situations
- Simulated space ops use-cases (life support, system reboot, diagnostics)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GirikratnaSharma/NOVA.git
cd NOVA
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir embeddings 
```

### 3. Run the Assistant
```bash
python app.py
```

Then ask questions like:
```plaintext
> "How do I reboot the backup oxygen system?"
> "What’s the last known log on the CO2 levels?"
```
